# Ignore compiled Python files
*.pyc

# Ignore virtual environment directories
/__pycache__/
pyvenv.cfg

# Ignore binary and generated files
bin/
lib/

# Add any other specific files or patterns you want to ignore here
# For example, you can ignore log files with the following line:
# *.log
This .gitignore file will instruct Git to ignore compiled Python files (e.g., *.pyc), virtual environment-related files (/__pycache__/ and pyvenv.cfg), binary files in the bin/ and lib/ directories, and log files if you uncomment the last line and add specific patterns for log files.
